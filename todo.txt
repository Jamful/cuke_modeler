Priority
-------------
update readme

Show less boilerplate code in the documentation

Add special character output examples to documentation for doc strings and cells
move Containing module into base model class
actual assertions in executable documentation instead of just explosion checks
verbiage update 'element' -> 'model'

Example table and step table share common functionality via module
Row and TableRow use superclass for common functionality (e.g. ExampleRow, TableRow, Row)


have abstract models start with 'minimum viable gherkin' values (e.g. '' and [])


Have tags use the Named module?

replace 'element' verbiage with 'model' verbiage in high level documentation

replace joined array source text with single string source text/heredocs


rewrite Cucumber features so that they are documentation instead of just tests (post remodel)

document helper modules as not part of the public API


Make sure that unit specs don't have file I/O in them
Make sure that specs use clazz instead of fully specifying the class under test
Don't bother to test directory create/destroy around unit tests



Backlog
-------------

Named, Tagged, etc. --> Nameable, Tagable, etc.?

#feature or #features for feature files? (and including both in test verificaitons)

More definition around element creation input arguments and parsing results
Single featyure or collection of features for feature file elements?
All specs stem from an acceptance test?
Double check/review class level documentation
All elements share common superclass for easy identification/behavior sharing?
All specs must come from a documented feature/behavior?
Still need behavior modules if only included in the super parent class?
unit testing around parsing cases (whitespace, indentation, minimalistic feature elements, etc.)

              replace "\n" usages with the currently set record separator (i.e "\$" )
Example table and step table share common functionality via module
Row and TableRow use superclass for common functionality
Clean up step verifications
Remove dead steps
Figure out why using empty files for directory_modeling.feature doesn't work
See if the 'stringio' require is really needed.
See if the 'version' require is really needed.
parsing module needs json/multijson require line?

Fix transient test failures (permission denied file access problems)

@default_file_directory -> @test_directory

make sure that all classes and tests are covered and attaches to code coverage

                                use 'here doc' for source text construction in rspec tests


# todo - remove hard coded newlines in feature files so that Relish and other text editors can wrap them on its own
# todo - incorporate cuke_modeler extensions from other projects
# todo - add plenty of testing around weird and minimal gherkin text for all models
