Priority
-------------

Show less boilerplate code in the documentation
replace copying raw data during adaptation (all of the Marshal#load/#unload calls) with simply testing that modification never happens in order to increase performance?



# todo - add compatibility with newer versions of Gherkin
# todo - incorporate cuke_modeler extensions from other projects
# todo - add plenty of testing around weird and minimal gherkin text for all models
# todo - add support for `Rule` keyword
# todo - incorporate new flexibility of `Example` keyword, etc.
# todo - Have CukeModeler::Parsing.dialect also control the default dialect used by Gherkin

Backlog
-------------

Include comments in the string output of a feature file

replace joined array source text with single string source text/heredocs
unit testing around parsing/modeling cases (whitespace, indentation, minimalistic feature elements, etc.)
replace "\n" usages with the currently set record separator (i.e "\$" )
make sure that all classes and tests are covered and attaches to code coverage
- make an actual Gherkin 5 adapter (just inherit from the Gherkin 4 adapter)
